Brown was a well known nuclear physicist andastrophysicist who worked at Stony Brook University from 1968 untilhis death in 2013. He was internationally active in physics researchfrom the late 1950s onwards, ran an active research group at StonyBrook until 2009, and supervised nearly a hundred PhD students duringhis life. He was also my father.It's hard to write about someone who is owned, in part, by so manypeople. I came along late in my father's life (he was 48 when I wasborn), and so I didn't know him that well as an adult.  However,growing up with a senior professor as a father had a huge impact onmy scientific career, which I can recognize even more clearly nowthat I'm a professor myself.Gerry (as I called him) didn't spend much time directly teaching hischildren about his work.  When I was invited to write something forhis memorial book, it was suggested that I write about what he hadtaught me about being a scientist. I found myself stymied, because tothe best of my recollection we had never talked much about thepractice of science. When I mentioned this to my oldest brother, Hans,we shared a good laugh  -- he had exactly the same experience with ourfather, 20 years before me!Most of what Gerry taught me was taught by example. Below are some ofthe examples that I remember most clearly, and of which I'm the mostproud. While I don't know if either of my children will becomescientists, if they do, I hope they take these to heart -- I can thinkof few better scientific legacies to pass on to them from my father.\section*{Publishing work that is interesting (but perhaps not correct) can makefor a fine career.}My father was very proud of his publishing record, but not because hewas always (or even frequently) right. In fact, several people told methat he was somewhat notorious for having a 1- in-10 ``hit rate'' -- hewould come up with many crazy ideas, of which only about 1 in 10 wouldbe worth pursuing. However, that 1 in 10 was enough for him to have along and successful career.  That this drove some people nuts wasmerely an added bonus in his view.Gerry was also fond of publishing controversial work. Several times hetold me he was proudest of the papers that caused the most discussionand collected the most rebuttals. He wryly noted that thesepapers often gathered many citations, even when theyturned out to be incorrect.\section*{The best collaborations are both personal and professionalfriendships.}The last twenty-five years of Gerry's life were dominated by acollaboration with Hans Bethe on astrophysics, and they traveled toPasadena every January until the early 2000s to work at the CaliforniaInstitute of Technology. During this month they lived in the sameapartment, worked together closely, and met with a wide range ofpeople on campus to explore scientific ideas; they also went on longhikes in the mountains above Pasadena (chronicled by Chris Adami in\cite{adami2006three}). These close interactions not only fueled hisresearch for the remainder of the year, but emanated from a deep personalfriendship. It was clear that, to Gerry, there was little distinctionbetween personal and professional in his research life.\section*{Science is done by people, and people need to be supported.}Gerry was incredibly proud of his mentoring record, and did his bestto support his students, postdocs, and junior colleagues bothprofessionally and personally. He devoted the weeks around Christmaseach year to writing recommendation letters for junior colleagues. Hespent years working to successfully nominate colleagues to theNational Academy of Sciences. He supported junior faculty withsignificant amounts of his time and sometimes by forgoing his ownsalary to boost theirs. While he never stated it explicitly, heconsidered most ideas somewhat ephemeral, and thought that his reallegacy -- and the legacy most worth having -- lay in the students andcolleagues who would continue after him.\section*{Always treat the administrative staff well.}Gerry was fond of pointing out that the secretaries and administrativestaff had more practical power than most faculty, and that it wasworth staying on their good side. This was less a statement ofcalculated intent and more an observation that many students,postdocs, and faculty treated non-scientists with less respect thanthey deserved. He always took the time to interact with them on apersonal level, and certainly seemed to be well liked for it. I'vebeen told by several colleagues who worked with Gerry that this was alesson that they took to heart in their own interactions with staff,and it has also served me well.\section*{Hard work is more important than brilliance.}One of Gerry's favorite quotes was ``Success is 99\% perspiration, 1\%inspiration'', a statement attributed to Thomas Edison. According toGerry, he simply wasn't as smart as many of his colleagues, but hemade up for it by working very hard. I have no idea how modest he wasbeing -- he was not always known for modesty -- but he certainlyworked very hard, spending 10-14 hours a day writing in his homeoffice, thinking in the garden, or meeting with colleagues atwork. While I try for more balance in my work and life myself, hedemonstrated to me that sometimes grueling hard work is a necessitywhen tackling tricky problems: for example, my Earthshinepublications (e.g. \cite{goode2001earthshine}) came after atremendously unpleasant summer working on some incredibly messy andvery tedious analysis code, but without the resulting analysis wewouldn't have been able to advance the project (which continues today,almost two decades later).\section*{Experiments should talk to theory, and vice versa.}Steve Koonin once explained to me that Gerry was a phenomenologist -- atheorist who worked well with experimental data -- and that thisspecialty was fairly rare because it required communicatingeffectively across sub disciplines. Gerry wasn't attracted to deeptheoretical work and complex calculations, and in any case liked totalk to experimentalists too much to be a good theorist -- for example,some of our most frequent dinner guests when I was growing up werePeter Braun- Munzinger and Johanna Stachel, both experimentalists. Sohe chose to work at the interface of theory and experiment, where hecould develop and refine his intuition based on competing world viewsemanating from the theorists (who sought clean mathematical solutions)and experimentalists (who had real data that needed to be reconciledwith theory). I have tried to pursue a similar strategy incomputational biology.\section*{Computers and mathematical models are tools, but the real insightcomes from intuition.}Apart from some early experience with punch cards at Yale in the1950s, Gerry avoided computers and computational models completely inhis own research (although his students, postdocs and collaboratorsused them, of course). I am told that his theoretical models wereoften relatively simple approximations, and he himself often said thathis work with Hans Bethe proceeded by choosing the right approximationfor the problem at hand -- something at which Bethe excelled. Theirchoice of approximation was guided by intuition about the physicalnature of the problem as much as by mathematical insight, and theycould often use a few lines of the right equations to reach resultssimilar to complex computational and mathematical models. This searchfor simple models and the utility of physical intuition in hisresearch characterized many of our conversations, even when I becamemore mathematically trained.\section*{Teaching is largely about conveying intuition.}Once a year, Gerry would load up a backpack with mason jars full ofthousands of pennies, and bring them into his Statistical Mechanicsclass. This was needed for one of his favorite exercises -- a hands-ondemonstration of the Law of Large Numbers and the Central LimitTheorem, which lie at the heart of thermodynamics and statisticalmechanics. He would have students flip 100 coins and record theaverage, and then do it again and again, and have the class plot thedistributions of results. The feedback he got was that this was a verygood way of viscerally communicating the basics of statisticalmechanics to students, because it built their intuition about howaverages really worked. This approach has carried through to my ownteaching and training efforts, where I always try to integratehands-on practice with more theoretical discussion.\section*{Benign neglect is a good default for mentoring.}Gerry was perhaps overly fond of the concept of ``benign neglect'' inparenting, in that much of my early upbringing was at the hands of mymother with only occasional input from him. However, in his oft-statedexperience (and now mine as well), leaving smart graduate students andpostdocs to their own devices most of the time was far better thantrying to actively manage (or interfere in) their research for them. Ithink of it this way: if I tell my students what to do and I'm wrong(which is likely, research being research), then they either do it(and I suffer for having misdirected them) or they don't do it (andthen I get upset at them for ignoring me). But if I don't tell mystudents what to do, then they usually figure out something better forthemselves, or else get stuck and then come to me to discuss it. Thelatter two outcomes are much better from a mentoring perspective thanthe former two.\section*{Students need to figure it out for themselves.}One of the most embarrassing (in retrospect) interactions I had withmy father was during a long car ride where he tried to convince methat when x was a negative number, -x was positive. At the time, Ididn't agree with this at all, which was probably because I was a stubborn7 years old. While it took me a few more years tounderstand this concept, by the time I was a math major I did have theconcept down! Regardless, in this, and many other interactions around science,he never browbeat me about it or got upset at my stupidity orstubbornness. I believe this carried through to his interactions withhis students. In fact, the only time I ever heard him expressexasperation was with colleagues who were acting badly.\section*{A small nudge at the right moment is sometimes all that is needed.}A pivotal moment in my life came when Gerry introduced me to MarkGalassi, a physics graduate student who also was the systemsadministrator for the UNIX systems in the Institute for TheoreticalPhysics at Stony Brook; Mark found out I was interested in computersand gave me access to the computer system. This was one of thedefining moments in my research life, as my research is entirelycomputational!  Similarly, when I took a year off from college, myfather put me in touch with Steve Koonin, who needed a systemsadministrator for a new project; I ended up working with theEarthshine project, which was a core part of my research for severalyears. And when I was trying to decide what grad schools to apply to,Gerry suggested I ask Hans Bethe and Steve Koonin what they thoughtwas the most promising area of research for the future -- theirunequivocal answer was ``biology!''  This drove me to apply tobiology graduate schools, get a PhD in biology, and ultimately led tomy current faculty position. In all these cases, I now recognize theapplication of a light touch at the right moment, rather than theheavy-handed guidance that he must have desperately wanted to give attimes.\section*{Conclusion}There are many more personal stories that could be told about GerryBrown, including his (several, and hilarious) interactions with the EastGerman secret police during the cold war, his (quite bad) jokes, his(quite good) cooking, and his (enthusiastic) ballroom dancing, but Iwill save those for another time. I hope that his friends andcolleagues will see him in the examples above, and will remember himfondly.\subsection*{Acknowledgments}I thank Chris Adami, Erich Schwarz, Tracy Teal, and my mother,Elizabeth Brown, for their comments on drafts of this article.\bibliography{gerry}\end{document}
